IMX219-83 CAMERA CALIBRATION

Stereo camera calibration involves determining the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of two cameras placed in a stereo configuration. Intrinsic parameters describe the optical properties of the individual camera, while extrinsic parameters describe the relative position and orientation between cameras.

To carry out the intrinsic calibration, some images of a chessboard (8X6) in various positions and orientations were captured with camera 0. It is also possible to use the same code for calibration with images from camera 1. 

Code using the Python programming language together with the OpenCV library.
