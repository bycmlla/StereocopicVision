Stereo camera calibration is an essential process in creating depth maps from stereoscopic images. This procedure aims to determine the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the cameras, enabling precise correspondence between points in the two images. Intrinsic parameters include features such as focal length and principal point, while extrinsic parameters define the relative position and orientation between the cameras.

During calibration, known patterns such as chessboards are used to capture images at different positions and orientations. Based on the disparities between the projections of known 3D points in the stereo images, the parameters are refined through optimization algorithms.

Once calibrated, stereo cameras can be used to compute disparity maps, representing the differences in object positions between the left and right images. When converted to depth maps, these provide three-dimensional information about the scene. This technique finds widespread applications in computer vision, robotics, and virtual reality, contributing to obtaining more accurate spatial information from stereoscopic images.
